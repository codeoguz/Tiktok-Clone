### A repo of a MERN tutorial

I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8yGxDMyGiE&t=3254s">this</a> tutorial to get used to writing React. I had no React knowledge while building the app. It was done with MERN and I used Heroku and Firebase to complete the project. This is a clone of Tiktok's home page. You can go through videos which fetches video urls from MongoDB. And, used Firebase to host the app while Heroku for API service.

You can see the screenshots inside the app:

What I learned:
- What is MongoDB, Heroku, Firebase Hosting.
- How to deploy an app from 2 project (fronten and backend are separate)
- Some React concepts: useState, useEffect
